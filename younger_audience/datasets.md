# Dataset for ML classes (younger audience)


### Dogs dataset

The Stanford Dogs dataset contains images of 120 breeds of dogs from around the world. This dataset has been built using images and annotation from ImageNet for the task of fine-grained image categorization. It was originally collected for fine-grain image categorization, a challenging problem as certain dog breeds have near identical features or differ in colour and age.

Number of categories: 120
Number of images: 20,580
Annotations: Class labels, Bounding boxes

### Waste classification data

(I really like this one). Dataset is divided into train data (85%) and test data (15%). Training data - 22564 images and Test data - 2513 images.

### Gender and ethnicity of job applicants 

Is the cross-entropy between the distribution of applicants to a given job by the listed social groups vs. the overall description meaningfully tied to the language of the postings? Is there enough data here to conclude either way?

### Chocolate bar rating

Chocolate is one of the most popular candies in the world. Each year, residents of the United States collectively eat more than 2.8 billions pounds. However, not all chocolate bars are created equal! This dataset contains expert ratings of over 1,700 individual chocolate bars, along with information on their regional origin, percentage of cocoa, the variety of chocolate bean used and where the beans were grown.

This is the sentiment140 dataset. It contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the twitter api . The tweets have been annotated (0 = negative, 4 = positive) and they can be used to detect sentiment .
